2024-10-12

## Changes Made
- Updated the overall layout to use a modern glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds and backdrop blur effects.
- Changed the announcement text box to a gradient background (from pink to purple) with lighter text color (white/70) for better readability and modern aesthetics.
- Replaced plain buttons for app downloads with styled divs featuring glassmorphism: semi-transparent backgrounds, borders, rounded corners, shadows, and hover scale effects.
- Adjusted text colors to use white/70 for consistency and better contrast on dark backgrounds.
- Improved spacing and gap between elements for a more balanced layout.
- Enhanced the web version button with a gradient background similar to the elegant button styles.
- Added custom pulse animation for the announcement text to draw attention.
- Removed unnecessary custom CSS and integrated styles using Tailwind classes for maintainability.

## Modern Practices Applied
- **Layout**: Used responsive grid for app download sections, improved flexbox for alignment.
- **Colors**: Incorporated gradients and semi-transparent colors for a contemporary look, with lighter text for accessibility.
- **Text**: Standardized font weights and sizes, used lighter colors for secondary text.

This update makes the Welcome component more visually appealing and aligns with modern web design trends.
